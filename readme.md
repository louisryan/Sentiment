If you don't know what an iPython notebook is, it's a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document. It lends itself well to the iterative process that is Data Analysis.

### Text Analysis

In the past number of years, there has been a huge surge in social platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to the point where they are ubiquitous. As more and more companies use Social Media Marketing to promote their brand, it becomes increasingly important for them to evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns. One such measure is Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis allows you to determine the polarity of the customer towards particular content, campaigns in real-time and allows you to adjust your strategy accordingly.

This analysis will implement the Naive Bayes classifier, a simple probabilistic classifier which is based on Bayes theorem with strong and naïve independence assumptions. It is one of the most basic text classification techniques with various applications in email spam detection, personal email sorting, document categorization, sexually explicit content detection, language detection and sentiment detection. Despite the naïve design and oversimplified assumptions that this technique uses, Naive Bayes performs well in many complex real-world problems.
